# SpaceX_Launch_Visualizer
The SpaceX Launches Dashboard is a web application built using Flask that allows users to explore SpaceX launch data. It categorizes launches into successful, failed, and upcoming launches, providing essential details about each launch, such as the mission name, launch date, rocket name, and launch site. The application also includes a custom template filter to format the launch date.

Features
Categorized Launches: The dashboard neatly organizes SpaceX launches into three categories: successful, failed, and upcoming. This makes it easy for users to find the information they're interested in.

Launch Details: Each launch entry provides detailed information, including the mission name, launch date, rocket name, and launch site.

Filtering: Users can filter launches based on their success status (successful, failed) and upcoming status, allowing for a more refined exploration of the data.

Custom Template Filter: The application utilizes a custom template filter to display launch dates in a user-friendly format, showing only the date portion.
